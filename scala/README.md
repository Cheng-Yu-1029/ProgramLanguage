Follow the [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala?authMode=login#about) in Cousera.

There are the cources' codes in the floder [coursera functional](https://github.com/Mr-Phoebe/ProgramLanguage/tree/master/scala/coursera-functional).

In floder [spark](https://github.com/Mr-Phoebe/ProgramLanguage/tree/master/scala/spark), the project comes from aother course. The details will be shown in its README.  

In the root, the codes are writen by myself. And they have been ordered and labelled.

The course notes are posted in [CSDN blog](http://blog.csdn.net/u013007900/article/category/7411050). And the Markdown files are kept in [notes](https://github.com/Mr-Phoebe/ProgramLanguage/tree/master/scala/notes).
