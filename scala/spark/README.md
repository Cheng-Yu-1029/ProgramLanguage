## statement

This code is from the course, and I have changed the original code for practice.  

**And say something about this project's architecture. This part is important!**  

1. This project is managed by [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), which is very similar to maven. And it looks like more easily to be used than maven. If you like, you can learn some basic knowledge about Gradle. I think it is useful.  
    - If you don't want to download or install Grable, you can run the executable file `gradlew` directly.
2. This project **don't need the spark environment**. Gradle packaged the spark API into jar, so the project onlt need Java and Scala. But you need to run gradle first to build the jar.
    - It will be OK if you install spark by yourself.
